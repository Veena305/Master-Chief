Take one glass of water or more as compared to you how much juicy you want;
Take a utnsil and pour water in it;
Make the gas on a medium flame;
When the water starts little boiling;
Then add a packet of maggi;
Add the maggi masala to add the yummy taste;
Starr the maggi properly;
It will take 4 or 5 min to be ready;
When the maggi becomes soft then you can remove;
And serve the maggi in the plate;
Now your maggi is ready to be eaten;
Enjoy;
